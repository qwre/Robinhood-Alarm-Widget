# Robinhood Alarm Widget 🟪

Client-side alarm widget for **Robinhood Web**.  
It runs entirely in the browser, reads prices from the existing page DOM, and plays a sound when your target price is hit.
---

## Features 🔥

- Add price alarms for any symbol visible on Robinhood Web  
- Uses only the HTML/JS that is already loaded in your browser  
- No backend, no database, no extra infrastructure  
- Sound alert when the target price is reached  
- Lightweight UI with a dark, gradient background

---

## How it works

1. You open Robinhood Legends in your browser.  
2. The widget reads the current price from the DOM (no API calls).

This project does **not**:
- Send extra requests to Robinhood  
- Bypass security or modify your account  
- Store or upload your data
